# Palma's Eldritch Codex - Portfolio Website

Hi! My name is João and this is a portfolio website I made to showcase my love for pretty interfaces and D&D. 

I do my best to make the website accessible to everyone, so if you have any disability or difficulty using the website please let me know and I'll try and make it better. I really try my best - I just don't know everything and I am always learning. 

I hope to use it to keep track of my progress and projects and hopefully inspire someone to make their own personalized website to their own image.

Thank you for having the time to read this! And may we chat sometime, friend!

## 🎨 Why This Design?

I wanted to create something that reflects who I am - someone who loves both clean sleek interfaces but also that retro old-school RPG style. Every interaction is designed to feel a bit nostalgic while still being functional and accessible.

## 🙏 A Personal Note

This website is a labor of love and a constant work in progress. If you're inspired to create your own unique portfolio, I'd love to see what you come up with! We all have our own stories to tell and our own creative ways to tell them.

Keep coding, keep creating, and most importantly keep hydrated!
